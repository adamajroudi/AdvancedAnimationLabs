# Advanced Animation Labs

Welcome to the repository for the Advanced Animation labs! This directory contains various labs that showcase different aspects of coding and animation. Here's a detailed overview:

## Lab Descriptions

### 1. Lab 906 - First Program
- **Description:** Introduces fundamental programming concepts using JavaScript. Students learn the basics of coding structure, syntax, and execution.

### 2. Lab 913 - First Class
- **Description:** Explores the creation of classes in JavaScript, focusing on object-oriented programming principles. Students implement their first class-based projects.

### 3. Lab 916 - Rotation
- **Description:** Delves into animation techniques, specifically rotation. Students apply trigonometric concepts to animate objects and create dynamic visual effects.

### 4. Lab 919 - Attraction/Repulsion
- **Description:** Investigates the simulation of forces, such as attraction and repulsion, within a coding context. Students create interactive programs demonstrating these physical principles.

### 5. Start Template
- **Description:** Provides a starting template for animation projects. This template includes essential files and structures to kickstart various animation-related coding endeavors.
